# GarlockFault
I collected magnetic data over Garlock Fault and modeled it using a non linear regression in MATLAB. I modeled it both as a line of poles and the dipping trapezoid magnetic model and found the dipping trapezoid model to be the best fit. This makes sense physically, as the fault plane itself likely has some oblique motion. What makes this anomaly unique is its positive anomaly. Usually, faults produce negative anomalies. A positive anomaly can be caused by a difference in magnetism of the bedrock, but this data isn't enough to determine what causes it.
